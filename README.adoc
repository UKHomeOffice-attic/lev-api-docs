== Mock API
It is possible to run a mock version of the API as follows:

=== Running a mock API with docker
The easiest way to run the mock API is with Docker
```
./mock/run_mock_api_docker.sh
```

=== Running a mock API without docker
It is also possible to run it without docker if you have the wiremock jar file:
```
cd mock
java -jar wiremock.jar --port=8080
```

== Authenticating yourself with the API

To use the API you will need to provide 2 forms of authentication:
. A client certificate
. An auth token, which must be obtained by hitting the /oauth/login endpoint

*NB: The client certificate must be included in every request, but is NOT shown in this documentation.*

The following examples are provided to help troubleshoot any issues:

=== Valid request with correct credentials
*Example request with curl*
